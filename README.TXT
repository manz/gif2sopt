Here's the latest version of GIF2SOPT together with it's source
code for anyone who's interested.

There is now another command line option -f which disables
flip optimisation (ie. removing a tile because it is the same
as a h/v flipped version of another tile). This is useful if
you're using GIF2SOPT to generate mode 7 data where you can't
flip tiles.
